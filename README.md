# Graph_UI
An application I made for a graph theory course in college, allowing the user to draw graphs and check certain properties. 
- The user can toggle the type of the drawn graph. It can be changed by clicking the "type button" on the top left of the screen, then click "toggle orientation". By default, the graph is not oriented.
- To draw a graph, the user can draw nodes by left clicking on the draw area, then draw edges between two nodes by  first right-clicking on the start node, then the end node
- The graph's adjancy list can be saved by clicking the top left button "save". The adjancy list will be saved as a .txt file
- After drawing a graph, several options are available. By selecting the "components" button, the user can see the connected components(the nodes in a component will have the same color) of an unordered graph, see the strongly connected components or the topological sort of an ordered graph and check if the drawn graph is a tree
